This website I built is a product of my love for carribean food, I share a few of the dishes I like and their recipes.
I use HTML, CSS and JS to accomplish this work. Hope you will enjoy it. Any feedback is welcome!
Some of the functionalities: When you click on the picture of the dish it flip and give you the name of the dish and a link to the recipe
